Landlord Kimi was a phone call away. She always responded promptly and took care of any issue asap. She was always smiling and personable; you can tell she cares about the tenants and the apartment. Would recommend!",

Everyone in this area is super nice, the rooms are spacious, and it’s so close to campus. Plus rent is extremely affordable for me and my brother. I see myself living here next year and beyond.",

It’s a great location for walking to class or downtown at a very cheap price. Would highly recommend for anyone. Only caveat is little storage space.",
